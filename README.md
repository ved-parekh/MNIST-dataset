# MNIST-dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset). The code in this repository is for a neural network that can identify and categorize the images of the digits. I have attempted to write the neural network using just the Numpy library and separately using the TensorFlow library.
